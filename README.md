# Tic-Tac-Toe

*My version lies in [repository](https://github.com/ermaxnet/threehouse-project-4)!*

Once again, the bureaucrats from Treehouse did not miss my project. This time, I resent even more than the first. If grader bothered to look at my code, it would have seen that I did not use any intricate designs. All this was to be known to the students of Treehouse who passed the fourth stage. Therefore, the reason why my code was rejected can not be that it will be difficult for students to understand it.

However, disputes allow the team to get more of my money. So here's the version of my code on your layout.

### Have a nice game!

### I hope you will enjoy it. Max Eremin
